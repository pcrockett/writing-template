Writing Workspace Template
==========================

Because I like VS Code, Markdown, and Git.

Assumes you have Pandoc and Spellright VS Code plugins installed and enabled. Simply clone this repository, clear out [index.md](./index.md), and start writing there. To render your writing to HTML, hit Ctrl + P and start typing "Pandoc Render".
